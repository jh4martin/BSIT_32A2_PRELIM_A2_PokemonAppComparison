Pokemon - Master (Vanilla JS)
-This project is easy to code and to run. It is also a simple project that consists of HTML, CSS and JS. The website is very intuitive and more focused on the design and somehow has limitations.

Pokemon - Search (Node JS)
-This project is somewhat difficult to understand if you are a beginner only, as it needs node.js to run the program. The program can run in multiple devices across the same network. The project also focused in Frontend and Backend.

Conclusion:
The first project uses vanilla js is very easy to discuss to new students who are interested in learning web development as it is not that complicated since it is composed of HTML, CSS and JS only. The second project uses node js which is more advanced and is very broad to understand if you're new to programming, but when it comes to experts, they will understand it more.
